This is a program that extracts data from Bilboard's website and feed it into Spotify API (but spotipy will be used here) which in turn create a playlist on spotify for it.

The programs used were Selenium and Spotipy. Selenium was used to query the billboard website and extract the top 100 songs for a particular date and well as the singers. 
The singers list extracted was no longer used. Commented it out.
Spotipy was used to create a Spotify Playlist with the songs extracted.

With this, even if you are a Baby Boomer or a Gen X, you can create a playlist of the top songs in your childhood using this program.

The code looks messy but this is just for practice. Will be revamped later. Main thing is that it works now.
