This is a program that extracts data from Bilboard's website and feed it into Spotify API (but spotipy will be used here) which in turn create a playlist on spotify for it.

The programs used were Selenium and Spotipy. Selenium was used to query the billboard website and extract the top 100 songs for a particular date and well as the singers. 
Spotipy was used to create a Spotify Playlist with the songs extracted.

With this, even if you are a Baby Boomer or a Gen X, you can create a playlist of the top songs in your childhood using this program.
